## Details
booked is an online book sharing community.

- Users can of the booked website can:
  - Create, Edit, and Remove an account.
  - Add and Remove Books from their bookshelf.
  - Accept and Reject book requests from other users.
  - Request and Return books from other users.
  - Add a book to their Favorite books list.
  - Receive randomized book suggestions based on their genre preferences.
  - Rate and Comment on books in the Library.
  - Search the Library of books by Title and Author name.

- The website uses a mySQL database to store information about users, books, a user's copy of a book, and the history of each book being borrowed by others.

## What We Learned
- We learned proper git merging techniques, as well as strategies to prevent and fix merge conflicts.

- We learned about implementing a composite key in MySQL and how to properly utilize the associated objects in Java.

- We gained more familiarity with using an http session to keep track of a user while he/she is logged in, and controlling the user's ability to access certain pages of the website.
